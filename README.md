## Blackjack Game

## Project Description

I will be using the deck of cards API  to create a game of blackjack in which the user will play against a computerized dealer.

{
    "success": true,
    "deck_id": "dgi0dmeyo06i",
    "cards": [

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
- User able to successfully Hit and Stay
- Dealer hits on anything below soft 17. 
- Aces become a value of 1 when total cards becomes greater than 21
- User Begins with chips and gains or loses based on play.

#### PostMVP  

- User able to bet chips.
- Advanced CSS. CSS animations and showing some modern personality.
- Refactor JS to make it as clean and smart as possible.
